## About live php server setup

Note: The setup is only tested on firefox and chrome ~ Sahil.

Setting up:

Step1: Clone this repo and start the php server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sahilrajput03/learning-php
cd learning-php
npm i
npm start
```

Step2: Install the browser extension so browser can know if some files have changed in disk and then it will simply üíìÔ∏é refresh the server page on every change. You can install the extension by navigating to appropriate links for your browser.

[Chrome extension page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/live-server-web-extension/fiegdmejfepffgpnejdinekhfieaogmj/)

[Firefox extension page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/live-server-web-extension/).

Note üò¨Ô∏éüò¨Ô∏é: You need to set the setting in the browser extension like that else you are on your own üôèÔ∏é -

## More knowledge about the setup

With `live-sever` cli your server will run on origin: http://localhost:8080 and thus you can configure your browser live-server extension like shown below exactly(Note: We are serving our php server @ port 3000, see scripts in package.json for more details).

Note you must NOT (although we want it to run at port 8080 only, live-server by default server files @ port 8080 though) specify `--port 8080` in live-server command, coz that seems to cause any problem and live reloading in browser isn't working that way.

### In future problems for the setup ?

The github repo of browser extension tool is [here](https://github.com/ritwickdey/live-server-web-extension).

### How did I learn about this setup ?

- if ever get free try this another promising extension(its popular on vscode though: <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ziishaned.livereload>).

        - Install **PHP-CS-Fixer** by running - `composer require --dev friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer`
            - Make sure you add `vendor` directory to your `.gitignore` file.

- Formatting php with Prettier ([Src](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63228491))
    -  Format with Prettier: Just install this package `npm i -D @prettier/plugin-php` to your project and you are good then.., (i.e., saving a file now also formats php files as well).
    - *NOTE IF your formatter does not work in VsCode* then please check this as it helped fix my issue of formatting in vscode today 12 July 2025. [Github Issue](https://github.com/prettier/plugin-php/issues/1730)
- Run command: `php -S localhost:8000` to run current folder at 8000 port.

- Via apache2: Visit: localhost/1.php to run a php file for browser.

- The file name must have extension .php otherwise the html content will render for sure but the php code won't execute at all.

Browse `localhost/docs` to view the default page of apache2 server.

        PHP Variables

        A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

        Rules for PHP variables:

        A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
        A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
        A variable name cannot start with a number
        A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
        Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)

// To specify strict we need to set declare(strict_types=1);. This must be on the very first line of the PHP file.

// The Example is from: https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_functions.asp
