## About live php server setup

Note: The setup is only tested on firefox and chrome ~ Sahil.

Setting up:

Step1: Clone this repo and start the php server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sahilrajput03/learning-php
cd learning-php
npm i
npm start
```

Step2: Install the browser extension so browser can know if some files have changed in disk and then it will simply üíìÔ∏é refresh the server page on every change. You can install the extension by navigating to appropriate links for your browser.

[Chrome extension page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/live-server-web-extension/fiegdmejfepffgpnejdinekhfieaogmj/)

[Firefox extension page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/live-server-web-extension/).

Note üò¨Ô∏éüò¨Ô∏é: You need to set the setting in the browser extension like that else you are on your own üôèÔ∏é -

## More knowledge about the setup

With `live-sever` cli your server will run on origin: http://localhost:8080 and thus you can configure your browser live-server extension like shown below exactly(Note: We are serving our php server @ port 3000, see scripts in package.json for more details).

Note you must NOT (although we want it to run at port 8080 only, live-server by default server files @ port 8080 though) specify `--port 8080` in live-server command, coz that seems to cause any problem and live reloading in browser isn't working that way.

### In future problems for the setup ?

The github repo of browser extension tool is [here](https://github.com/ritwickdey/live-server-web-extension).

- Via apache2: Visit: localhost/1.php to run a php file for browser.

- The file name must have extension .php otherwise the html content will render for sure but the php code won't execute at all.
