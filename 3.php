<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

In PHP, keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are not case-sensitive.

<br>
Note: However; all variable names are case-sensitive!
See next example for that^^.

<?php
ECHO "Hello World!<br>";
echo "Hello World!<br>";
EcHo "Hello World!<br>";
?>
